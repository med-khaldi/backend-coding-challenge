# backend-coding-challenge

My API it s solution for this coding challenge "https://github.com/ahaizoune/backend-coding-challenge" 

## Functional specs

- Develop a REST microservice that list the languages used by the 100 trending public repos on GitHub.
- For every language, you need to calculate the attributes below ðŸ‘‡:
    - Number of repos using this language *
    - The list of repos using the language

## Note 
- I use only 29 trending public repos because i can't found 100 repos.
